# My personal configuration to install on Ubuntu

I made shell script of most important application using inside Ubuntu and bring easier configuration when need's to make new installation

Most of time if I install new software on Ubuntu and re-populated the same step here to guarantee that my new installation will keep the same and up and running to start my jog as soon as possible. :)
